Return `true` only if the profile clearly belongs to a *tech leadership individual* (e.g., CTO, VP of Engineering, Tech Founder, Head of Product, or Software Leader)..
If it does not meet this condition, return `false`.
Do not provide any explanation. Do not describe the profile. Return only one word: true or false.
